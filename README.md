INTRODUCTION
------------
What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a set of commitments that are defined in digital form, including the agreement on how contract participants shall fulfill these commitments. Blockchain technology gives us a decentralized, non-tamperable, highly reliable system in which smart contracts are extremely useful. Smart contracts are one of the most important characteristics of blockchain technology and the reason why blockchains can be called a “disruptive” technology. It is increasing the efficiency of our social structure day by day.
